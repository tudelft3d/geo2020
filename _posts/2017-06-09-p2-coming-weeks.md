For some of you the P2 is in the next 2 weeks. 
The timetable should be automatically in your "mytimetable.tudelft.nl" thing, but it seems that--again!--it went wrong. 
An alternative way is to do this:

Please read [graduation manual 2016-2017]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/rules/GraduationManualGeomatics2016-2017F161216.pdf) carefully to know what you need to do.
I'd like to focus your attention to this:

  Hand in the Graduation Plan to the Mentors and and send Graduation Plan to the Secretariat of the Board of Examiners at least one week before P2.

The email to use is <Examencommissie-BK@tudelft.nl>, and don't forget to send it directly to the chairperson of your P2, which is also the representative of the Board of Examiners. 
That person is listed as the 3rd one in your mytimetable entry.

For the graduation plan, see the [guidelines](https://tudelftgeomatics.github.io/thesis/templates/#p2-template).
Basically, use the template in the Appendix 2 of the [graduation manual 2016-2017](http://studenten.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/Files/studentenportal/os/BKspecifiek/Graduation_Manual_Geomatics_2016-2017.pdf) for the information needed, but for the main text, you can just write "see attached" and attach your text (written in LaTeX for example).

Your presentation is 15min, followed by 15min of questions, and then 15min for appraisal.
I know, I know, that makes 45min total, and not 1h as planned.


Good luck for the final preparations,
Hugo
