I have discussed with some of you and with some staff, and I get the impression that many of you are planning to do their graduation work at a company.
This is rather surprising since in the past very few did, perhaps 10-15% of the students.

As I said on Monday, [this is allowed but is in general more difficult to arrange](http://tudelftgeomatics.github.io/thesis/faq/#can-i-do-my-thesis-work-at-a-company) since the interests of the company are not the same as the ones of the TU Delft.

In the list of topics offered by the research groups, there are topics in collaboration with companies/institutions, and these have usually been discussed and an agreement with the staff has been already made.
But if you directly contact yourself a company, then finding a topic that is suitable for an MSc Geomatics thesis can be rather difficult.
We have had complex cases in the past, and in the end often students are victim of the differences in interests from both parties.

Keep in mind that the graduation work is a *scientific project*, and that a company can be involved but that the main mentors (1st and 2nd) are staff of the TU Delft.
For the P1/P2, no compromises will be made on the topic because a company is not interested in a particular topic.
