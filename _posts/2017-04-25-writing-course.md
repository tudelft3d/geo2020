To help you with writing your thesis, there is a small course organised.
Dirk Dubbeling, a staff at BK who has a lot of experience with editing books/monographs/magazine/etc, is the one who will give the course. 

When: Thuesday 27 June 2017, 10:00-11:30

Where: BK BG.West.270

Besides the course, I'd like to point out that on the website there are many things that can help you with writing:
