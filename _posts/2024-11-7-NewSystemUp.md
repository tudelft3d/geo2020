Dear all, 

From today on the new system to follow the graduation process is available:  [MyCase](https://mycase.tudelft.nl).

When you use the system, please be critical and let us know whether:

    1) the texts are clear, correct, and intuitive
    2) the links are working and correct
    3) any other comments/ tips

If you have any comments and/or questions, please send an email with a print screen of the page/problem to your Graduation coordinator (C.Garcia-Sanchez@tudelft.nl) and cc. the Faculty Administrator (graduation-bk@tudelft.nl).

The Main mentor             -> Responsible Supervisor

(Second) mentor               -> Supervisor

Thank you for helping us with this pilot!

Clara
