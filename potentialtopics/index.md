    <p>Procedure to select an MSc topic</p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    <ul>
      <li>You can pick a topic from June until September 15th the latest, where you need to have a topic and at least one supervisor selected</li>
      <li>Be warned that if you wait for September, then it is possible that your topic is already gone and your favourite supervisor is full</li>
      <li>A topic can be changed a bit until the P1 (mid-November)</li>
      <li>You can pick any topics below, or you can speak to a geomatics staff and if you agree on a topic, then submit it (with a temporary title)</li>
      <li>If your topic is in collaboration with an external party, keep in mind that several staff follow the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/openscience/">requirements for open science</a></li>
      <li>If you have agreed on a topic with a supervisor and they agree, no need to submit #2 and #3 topic, put blanks or just type *no further topics*</li>
      <li>Only the 1st supervisor is relevant at this point, the 2nd can be added later</li>
      <li>Questions? discord channel #geo2020 is the best place to ask</li>
    </ul>
