The [Gemeente Dordrecht](https://cms.dordrecht.nl) proposes the following ten topics.
The contact person is [Cunera Smit](mailto:cj.smit@dordrecht.nl).

1. Sustainable waterfrond (Westelijke Dordtse Oever): A harbour area with a business/industry district. We search for opportunities to strengsten the dike structure, improve the connection towards the roads of N3/A16, devolp the industry district and harbour area (which is a collaboration area with the Havenbedrijf Rotterdam). We also search for new energy solutions here, for example windmills, solar panels etc. Think about opportunities for innovative ideas in this large development area!

2. Long term investmentprogramme (Meerjaren Onderhoudsprogramma): Programme for the renewal projects within our city. The project is about improviseren the different plannings between our city development and city maintenance department. The goal is that inhabitants have les irritations/problems in their living area, for example less roadstructure works because they are combined. How to digitalize this proces?

3. Data driven neighbourhood approaches (Datagestuurde wijkaanpak): The social data that is used now to know How to improve the living (social) qualities in te neighbourhoods is "old" data (interviews, CBS data of research from 2 years ago). We want to collect more realtime data to improve our neighbourhood approaches. How to collect realtime data and how to combine these data for good analysis?

4. Data driven "city watch" (Datagestuurd Toezicht): We have a group of collegues Who oversee the city (Besides the police) for safety reasons and we want to use more realtime data to know where they are needed the most. For example hotspots of bike theft). How to collect these realtime data and manage our collegues through the city?

5. Digitalising Parking (Digitaliseren Parkeren): We want to organize a better spread of cars through and around our city (centre) in parkinggarages and on the streets. A good service for example could be that visitors can reserve a parkingplace before their arrival. This could be connected to our "poller" (moveable element to close streets for cars) system: How to organize the traffic flow with in the city using data?

6. Connection Stadswerven and city centre (Verbinding Stadswerven - binnenstad): Stadswerven is a development area eats to the city centre. Here is the Energiehuis (cultural building), Villa Augustus (hotel and restaurant) and a new movietheatre will open this year. It is an area for living, business and recreation. A new bridge is plannen to directly connect this area to the centre. But still: How to improve the link between Stadswerven and the city centre, by using (technological) innovations? 

7. Innovations in healthcare (Zorgvernieuwing): The healthcare system is decentralised from the national government/province to the municipalities in 2015. It is a system that is renewing, and therefore we are searching for innovations within this business (Domotica/Robotica) between the different healthcare partners. Which innovations can be implemented in this healthcare system (data sharing, robotica etc.)?

8. Notification system for defects in the public space (Wijklijnmeldingen systeem): We have a notification system for inhabitants to tell us if there are any defects in our public space, for example a broken streetlight or broken tile of a footpath. This system does not work properly and need to be optimized, especially on communication to the inhabitants. We already work together with students of the Hogeschool Rotterdam on this topic of communication, but how to use the data of this system in a proper way to improve our policy?

9. Involvement/participation of inhabitants (Partcipatie): As a municipality we stimulate inhabitants and entrepreneurs to get more involved in their own neighbourhood and city. How to organize this participation in an innovative way? There are different project within our municipality on this topic: How to smart connect?

10. Measuring pedestrian movement within the city (Passantenstromen): We have traffic models that measure the movement of cars and trucks in our city, but not the pedestrains and bycicles. For example from our central station, waterbus station, from our parkinggarages or from the new development area of the Stadswerven. We do not have a free wifi network within our city centre at the moment. How to collect the data from the movement of pedestrains and bycicles to have a better view on the flows of traffic in the city?
