## The official graduation material

## A0 (Preparation)

1. Find a thesis topic and supervisors, either by picking from a topic from [the list](../potentialtopics/) or by agreeing on a custom topic. Talk to the responsible Geomatics staff to know more about it and to confirm that you will do it.
2. Fill in the form below.
3. Together with your supervisors, schedule your A1 before the [registration deadline](../dates/). They will enter the date in the system (SuperSaaS).

## A1 (Kick-off)

1. Write a project proposal. If you want, you can use [this template](../templates/#proposal).
2. At least one week before your A1, register your graduation project in [MyCase](https://mycase.tudelft.nl), including uploading your proposal.
3. Your supervisors will read your proposal. At the kick-off meeting, your supervisors will ask you questions about it and decide if it's approved.
  - If you pass, together with your supervisors you should schedule the A3 and A4 before the [registration deadline](../dates/). If you are very keen on a specific co-reader (see A2), you should probably make sure they are available on those dates.
  - If you don't pass (retake), together with your supervisors you should schedule a new A1 date before the [registration deadline](../dates/).

## A2 (Midterm)

1. Discuss with your supervisors to know what you need to do for the midterm. It's good practice to have a more structured meeting to discuss your progress and (updated) plans.
2. Upload a document in [MyCase](https://mycase.tudelft.nl), such as the slides used for this meeting, updated project plan or the thesis as it stands. <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Note that without that upload they cannot approve your midterm in the system. Once they have approved it, you will be marked as in the Green light phase.
3. Pick a co-reader. This person will read and send feedback/questions to your supervisors. This person is chosen by your supervisors and you. It's the best person at TU Delft for the topic, but outsiders from other universities are allowed (and can attend online). The way you approach the co-reader is up to you, but an email with a short summary of the project and the A3 and A4 dates is a good option.

## A3 (Green light)

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> If you don't plan to do your A3 at the specified date, you must cancel your A3. Do it by sending an email to your 2 supervisors, the co-reader, the delegate, and to `afstuderen-bk@tudelft.nl`.

1. Discuss with your supervisors to know what you need to submit. Usually, a **draft** of your thesis is expected. A draft means what your supervisors say it should be, there are no strict rules (but [this](../faq/#what-is-a-complete-draft-at-p4) can help). If you want, you can use [this template](../templates/#thesis).
2. At least one week before your A3, you must register that you have completed the required parts of your study and upload your submission as a deliverable in [MyCase](https://mycase.tudelft.nl) and to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/47493) page (P4 Final).
3. Your supervisors and co-reader will read your submission. The first supervisor will check the Plagiarism Scan results. At the green light meeting, your supervisors will ask questions about it and decide if it's approved. The co-reader will send comments/questions to your first supervisor and might attend the meeting. 
  - If you pass (continue to Finalisation), a preliminary mark will also be given to you. Your final mark at the A4 might only be within 0.5 points of the preliminary one.
  - If you don't (retake), together with your supervisors you should schedule new A3 and A4 dates before the [registration deadline](../dates/).


## A4 (Finalisation)

1. At least one week before your A4, you must upload your submission as a deliverable in [MyCase](https://mycase.tudelft.nl) and to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/47493) page (P5 Final). It's also a good practice to [send a rebuttal/corrections document](../tips/#with-the-p5-thesis-submit-a-rebuttalcorrections-document) to your supervisors and co-reader.
2. Your supervisors and co-reader will read your submission. The first supervisor will check the Plagiarism Scan results. At the finalisation meeting, your supervisors and co-reader will ask questions about it and decide your final mark according to the [rubric](../rubric/).
3. Maximum 1 day after the A4, you have to upload your final thesis to the TU Delft repository, and please [follow these rules](../faq/#how-to-upload-your-final-thesis-to-the-tud-repository)
