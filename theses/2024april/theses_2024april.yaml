- Voxel based 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation at Urban scale
- Peter Van Oosterom
- Undecided
- Most 3D PC segmentation techniques today either attempt ML methodologies to achieve
  segmentation or labour intensive classification by people. The issue with ML techniques
  for segmentation is primarily related to the lack of sufficient training material
  to execute achieve a reliable classification. New research in this direction experiments
  with the utilisation of voxel structures to attempt segmentation of point cloud.
  This project is aimed at looking into the current techniques and assessing their
  applicability at the urban scale.

- Building Material component for the LADM
- Peter van Oosterom
- Wilko Quak
- The thesis focuses on explores the potential integration of Building Material into
  the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). It centers on advancing the circularity
  and sustainability of buildings by introducing an additional component in LADM.
  This element will consists of a database of materials organized by their components
  like quality, type etc, offering an understanding of their estimated lifespan. These
  materials can then be reused in new construction projects, taking into account geographical
  considerations like proximity and the type of building involved. The research aims
  to evaluate the feasibility and advantages of incorporating the building materials
  section into the existing LADM framework, utilizing case studies. Through this project,
  it aims to understand the implications for improving the circularity and efficiency
  of both land administration systems and building materials.

- A 3D delineation method for urban river spaces.
- Claudiu Forgaci
- Jantien Stoter
- An accurate spatial description, a spatial delineation, of riverside urban areas
  is essential for a wide range of applications, including flood mitigation and public
  space design. This thesis aims to develop a 3D delineation method for urban river
  spaces by adapting an existing 2D delineation approach. By adapting this 2D method,
  the aim is to develop a technique that is able to more accurately represent the
  spatial complexities of these areas. This thesis will tackle challenges related
  to using open 3D data effectively and exploring scalability options within the Netherlands
  but also possibly internationally.

- Usability Evaluation of Vario-Scale Maps for Dynamic and Interactive Mapping
- Martijn Meijers
- Peter Van Oosterom
- "The digital mapping environment is evolving from traditional fixed-scale maps to\
  \ dynamic, interactive solutions. This thesis proposes a usability study of the\
  \ 'vario-scale' approach, aimed at providing smoother map interactions.\n\nObjective\
  \ \nThe main objective is to assess the usability of vario-scale maps and suggest\
  \ empirical enhancements. The study will evaluate the user's ability to perform\
  \ realistic map-use tasks, focusing on ease of use, user satisfaction, and interaction\
  \ effectiveness.\n\nMethodology\nThe first step in this study will be a comprehensive\
  \ literature review. Next, prototypes will be developed following cartographic principles.\
  \ The study will explore the impact of map properties like label placement, and\
  \ vario-scale-specific properties, such as feature importance. The study participants\
  \ will perform map-use tasks, vocalising their thoughts to capture interaction impressions\
  \ and cognitive processes. For this, eye-tracking and screen-logging software will\
  \ be utilised.\n\nChallenges\nA significant challenge is user adaptability, as traditional\
  \ map users might find the vario-scale concept initially confusing. Additionally,\
  \ the study will require assessing the participants' backgrounds to tailor usability\
  \ tests, accommodating various familiarity levels. Developing targeted prototypes\
  \ that gradually introduce vario-scale features will be challenging. Identifying\
  \ optimal modifications of the map\u2019s properties for each prototype is crucial."

- Large-scale solar potential analyses based on Semantic 3D City Models
- "Camilo Le\xF3n S\xE1nchez"
- Giorgio Agugiaro
- Solar potential analysis is of great help to energy transition through city planning,
  analysis of occupant behavior, assessing building energy performance, and scheduling
  the power grid. Computing high resolution (spatial, temporal, and semantic) solar
  irradiance is the key step of solar potential analysis. To determine the solar irradiance
  with high resolution, we can utilize 3D City Models (3DCM). Within the context of
  3DCM, calculating shadows, sky-view factor (SVF), and ground view factor (GVF) are
  the most important and computationally intensive steps. Existing methods for the
  calculations, either apply simplifications or assumptions to make the computation
  achievable in a limited time. While some methods are accurate, but unable to scale
  to city-level. The thesis will be focused on developing a methodology that can achieve
  fast shadow solar irradiance with minimum assumptions. The expected methodology
  will be able to be applied to large areas such as the whole Netherlands
