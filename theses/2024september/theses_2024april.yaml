- " Most 3D PC segmentation techniques today either attempt ML methodologies to achieve \
  \ segmentation or labour intensive classification by people. The issue with ML techniques \
  \ for segmentation is primarily related to the lack of sufficient training material \
  \ to execute achieve a reliable classification. New research in this direction experiments \
  \ with the utilisation of voxel structures to attempt segmentation of point cloud. \
  \ This project is aimed at looking into the current techniques and assessing their \
  \ applicability at the urban scale. "

- " The thesis focuses on explores the potential integration of Building Material into \
  \ the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). It centers on advancing the circularity \
  \ and sustainability of buildings by introducing an additional component in LADM. \
  \ This element will consists of a database of materials organized by their components \
  \ like quality, type etc, offering an understanding of their estimated lifespan. These \
  \ materials can then be reused in new construction projects, taking into account geographical \
  \ considerations like proximity and the type of building involved. The research aims \
  \ to evaluate the feasibility and advantages of incorporating the building materials \
  \ section into the existing LADM framework, utilizing case studies. Through this project, \
  \ it aims to understand the implications for improving the circularity and efficiency \
  \ of both land administration systems and building materials."

- Claudiu Forgaci
- Jantien Stoter
- " An accurate spatial description, a spatial delineation, of riverside urban areas \
  \ is essential for a wide range of applications, including flood mitigation and public \
  \ space design. This thesis aims to develop a 3D delineation method for urban river \
  \ spaces by adapting an existing 2D delineation approach. By adapting this 2D method, \
  \ the aim is to develop a technique that is able to more accurately represent the \
  \ spatial complexities of these areas. This thesis will tackle challenges related \
  \ to using open 3D data effectively and exploring scalability options within the Netherlands \
  \ but also possibly internationally."

- "Usability Evaluation of Vario-Scale Maps for Dynamic and Interactive Mapping"
- Martijn Meijers
- Peter Van Oosterom
- "The digital mapping environment is evolving from traditional fixed-scale maps to\
  \ dynamic, interactive solutions. This thesis proposes a usability study of the\
  \ 'vario-scale' approach, aimed at providing smoother map interactions.\n\nObjective\
  \ \nThe main objective is to assess the usability of vario-scale maps and suggest\
  \ empirical enhancements. The study will evaluate the user's ability to perform\
  \ realistic map-use tasks, focusing on ease of use, user satisfaction, and interaction\
  \ effectiveness.\n\nMethodology\nThe first step in this study will be a comprehensive\
  \ literature review. Next, prototypes will be developed following cartographic principles.\
  \ The study will explore the impact of map properties like label placement, and\
  \ vario-scale-specific properties, such as feature importance. The study participants\
  \ will perform map-use tasks, vocalising their thoughts to capture interaction impressions\
  \ and cognitive processes. For this, eye-tracking and screen-logging software will\
  \ be utilised.\n\nChallenges\nA significant challenge is user adaptability, as traditional\
  \ map users might find the vario-scale concept initially confusing. Additionally,\
  \ the study will require assessing the participants' backgrounds to tailor usability\
  \ tests, accommodating various familiarity levels. Developing targeted prototypes\
  \ that gradually introduce vario-scale features will be challenging. Identifying\
  \ optimal modifications of the map\u2019s properties for each prototype is crucial."

- "Camilo Le\xF3n S\xE1nchez"
- Giorgio Agugiaro
- "Solar potential analysis is of great help to energy transition through city planning, \
  \ analysis of occupant behavior, assessing building energy performance, and scheduling \
  \ the power grid. Computing high resolution (spatial, temporal, and semantic) solar \
  \ irradiance is the key step of solar potential analysis. To determine the solar irradiance \
  \ with high resolution, we can utilize 3D City Models (3DCM). Within the context of \
  \ 3DCM, calculating shadows, sky-view factor (SVF), and ground view factor (GVF) are \
  \ the most important and computationally intensive steps. Existing methods for the \
  \ calculations, either apply simplifications or assumptions to make the computation \
  \ achievable in a limited time. While some methods are accurate, but unable to scale \
  \ to city-level. The thesis will be focused on developing a methodology that can achieve \
  \ fast shadow solar irradiance with minimum assumptions. The expected methodology \
  \ will be able to be applied to large areas such as the whole Netherlands."
