- Point Cloud for 3D Cadastral

- 'The rapid growth of urban areas has led to the development of increasingly complex
  high-rise buildings. This growth necessitates a land administration system (LAS)
  capable of optimally storing and visualizing the legal status of these structures,
  ideally through a 3D cadastral system. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been
  widely used in various studies to create 3D cadastral systems, demonstrating great
  potential for representing LAS. However, as not all buildings have BIM data available,
  it raises the question of how to address this limitation. Recent studies have used
  point clouds as the basis for creating digital twins, where object semantics can
  be derived through automatic point cloud segmentation. As point cloud data is more
  abundant than BIM data, this study aims to explore the extent to which point clouds
  can be used to visualize 3D cadastral information. To answer this research question,
  three sub-questions are proposed:

  1. How can point cloud data be processed and semantically enriched to identify and
  represent cadastral features and boundaries?

  2. How to integrate 3D point cloud into LADM (Land Administration Domain Model)?

  3. Which web architecture is suitable for visualizing the resulting 3D cadastre?'

- Standardizing data formats for 3D city models is vital for semantically storing
  real-world information as permanent records. CityJSON, an OGC standard, and its
  variant, CityJSONSeq, simplify data utilization by software. However, the shift
  to cloud-native environments and growing demands for processing large datasets require
  more efficient solutions. While formats like PMTiles, FlatBuffers, and Cloud Optimized
  GeoTIFF address vector and raster data, options for 3D city models remain limited.
  This research explores optimized data formats for CityJSON tailored for cloud-native
  processing, focusing on FlatBuffers. Features such as spatial indexing, spatial
  sorting, and partial HTTP Range requests will be implemented. The study includes
  a review of performance-optimized formats, adaptation to enhance CityJSON, and benchmarking.
  Results will enable end-users to efficiently download 3D city models and allow developers
  to store large datasets in single files, simplify cloud architecture, and improve
  processing. This work aims to enhance the scalability and usability of 3D city models,
  advancing urban planning and smart city applications.

- This project focuses on developing an efficient and cost-effective framework for
  LoD2 building modeling using only orthophotos. Traditional methods often rely on
  costly height data, such as LiDAR or DSM, making them inaccessible in resource-constrained
  regions. By leveraging geometric constraints and deep learning, this study aims
  to accurately reconstruct rooftop topologies without height information. Geometric
  constraints filter noisy or incomplete line segments, while deep learning enhances
  classification and refines structures using RGB features. A Markov Random Field
  (MRF) model integrates these results for improved plane detection. To ensure robustness,
  DSM or LiDAR data will be used as validation tools to compare performance under
  scenarios with and without height information. The proposed framework reduces modeling
  costs, extends accessibility, and supports scalable applications in urban planning,
  disaster management, and digital heritage preservation.

- 3D reconstruction of linear urban objects from aerial lidar point clouds

- 'The 3D models play a crucial role in urban planning, providing essential information
  for infrastructure design, land-use assessment, and environmental analysis. Most
  current reconstructions of 3D models focus on volumetric objects such as buildings,

  At an urban scale, aerial lidar point clouds serve as a valuable tool for capturing
  high-resolution 3D spatial data of the built environment, offering a foundation
  for generating these surface models. However, for large-scale point clouds, reconstructing
  individual instances of linear urban objects is challenging due to factors such

  Conventionally, building height estimation often relies on either LIDAR scanning
  or high-resolution aerial imagery, where shadow length is used to infer height.
  A technique will be proposed that reconstructs surfaces from point clouds to generate
  3D urban models, on which shadows are simulated and analysed to detect link specific
  shadows to their corresponding buildings more accurately. The end result of this
  combined method hopes to achieve more accurate height estimation for difficult objects
  such as antennas, than the sum of its parts would provide--that is, LIDAR and aerial

- Generating Synthetic Distributions of Housing Units for Modelling Economic Segregation

- Social simulations often overlook spatial frameworks, relying on oversimplified,
  abstract configurations, or real, context-dependent layouts. This research seeks
  a middle ground by developing a generator of synthetic distributions of housing
  units within Dutch urban layouts to study economic segregation, and to address the
  importance of spatial factors in modelling urban economic disparities. The approach
  involves analyzing geospatial characteristics (such as spatial patterns, density,
  land use, building types, and more) unique to Dutch cities, defining standardized,
  adjustable parameters, and integrating these into a spatial generator. The generator
  outputs a synthetic city environment where housing distributions reflect Dutch urban
  characteristics specified by the user-defined parameters, such as the number and
  type of households, based on the location in the city). The methodology supports
  urban planners, researchers, and policymakers in simulating housing distribution
  scenarios and studying their potential effects on economic segregation. A key challenge
  is determining whether to include socioeconomic dynamics in generating the synthetic
  city environment, as these may bias the model by influencing urban form and distribution.
  The anticipated outcome is a user-driven synthetic environment for simulating urban
  layouts and housing allocation to understand better the spatial dynamics of economic
  segregation, which can be used in simulations of economic segregation.

- Adjustment theory is a statistical process to detect and remove stochastic errors
  from measurements. This is being applied to aerial nadir imagery to help in the
  reduction of outside surveying for the mapping of the Basis regristratie Grootschalige
  Topografie (BGT). Unlike nadir images, currently obliques are not adjusted due to
  difficulties that stem in the trustworthiness of the control points in the image
  because of a varying pixel scale when compared to top down nadir. However, oblique
  images do provide extra data opportunities that would otherwise go lost for municipalities
  that want to cartograph the BGT or maybe even create digital twin. For this it is
  essential to keep the structure of the image the same during the adjustment process
  and thus not to morph it or overlay on any surface. Due to the strict precision
  that the kadaster holds to measurements in the BGT a raw unadjusted oblique image
  simply does not meet the standards laid out in the Handboek Technische Werkzaamheden
  (HTW) for the creation of the BGT. This leads us to the goal of the thesis which
  is to create a series of mathematically defined synthetic test cases that show the
  impact of key parameters as they relate to adjustment theory. A possible result
  of this could be that the key points are too inaccurate or that obscuring of objects
  in different angles leads to a bad fit. The lessons learned from such test cases
  could then be applied to real data to see whether they hold up in real data scenarios.

- Dense urbanization has led to increasing demand and pressure for land development,
  resulting in the partition of 3D space into different owners sharing delimited property
  interests on, above, or below the land surface. Consequently,(cadastral) spatial
  units range from simple, but most common, 2D, to complex 3D collections of spaces
  worldwide, that are more difficult to handle in terms of surveying, storing in a
  database, maintaining, visualizing, etc. This thesis project focuses on creating
  a web-based 3D cadastral prototype to accurately register and visualize geospatial
  information related to archaeological sites and their surroundings, integrating
  both legal and physical spatial data using the Land Administration Domain Model
  (LADM). Thus, exploring point cloud data for representing 3D structures and highlighting
  the relationship between legal spaces (e.g. ownership and jurisdiction) and physical
  objects (e.g. archaeological sites) would ensure a holistic view of the spatial
  arrangement. This LADM-based approach will enhance the integration and interoperability
  of archaeological records with existing cadastral data, supporting comprehensive
  lifecycle management and ensuring these valuable cultural assets are preserved within
  a legally standardized framework. In this context, relevant 3D storage and visualization
  standards related to data format, grammar, and implementation as with APIs and Web
  Feature Services should be explored (proposed by ISO, OGC, and W3C).

  model with energy-related data needed to estimate cooling demand. Algorithms will
  be developed to detect buildings with insufficient or inaccurate data, as these
  inaccuracies may cause discrepancies in cooling demand simulation results when comparing
  outcomes from different simulation methods. SimStadt and Nieman models will be used
  to simulate and compare cooling demand results. However, the Nieman model has limitations,
  such as the lack of 3D geometry integration, which leads to less reliable estimates.
  Furthermore, the simulations will consider the year 2050 to account for projected
  climate changes, which are expected to increase cooling demand due to rising temperatures.
  The simulation results will be analyzed, and a pipeline will be defined to store
  significant results into the 3DCityDB extended with the Energy ADE. This research

  effective methods for presenting these values.

- This study investigates the role of green infrastructure in enhancing urban resilience
  through predictive modeling for land use planning. Green infrastructure, including
  urban parks, forests, and linear street trees, are essential in enhancing environmental
  stability and fostering social aspects such as accessibility and supportive policies
  in urban areas. This research provides insights into how factors such as accessibility,
  spatial distribution of different green space typologies contributes to urban resilience,
  specifically the cooling of urban microclimates, managing stormwater, and accessibility
  to green spaces. Using spatial data and machine learning techniques, this study
  evaluates different modeling approaches to predict future changes in green space
  availability under varying environmental scenarios. The findings aim to support
  urban planners in making data-driven decisions to prioritise and optimise green
  spaces, thereby contributing to sustainable and resilient urban landscapes. This
  focused approach to green spaces offers a practical framework for cities seeking
  to strengthen ecological and community resilience through strategic land use planning.

- Exploring the impact of tree original point cloud data leverage in urban daylight
  simulation
- Azarakhsh Rafiee
- Eleonora Brembilla
- Daylighting is a key consideration in urban design contributing to the development
  of daylight simulations in the past few decades. However, the impact of urban trees
  is often not considered. However, in cases of 3D model reconstruction that include
  trees, the simplification of the past attempts to model trees overlook tree canopy
  porosity. Additionally, throughout the year, the seasonal changes on tree canopies
  are also often disregarded. This thesis topic revolves around the investigation
  of the method that integrates of point cloud data into daylighting simulations so
  that the porosity and the seasonal alterations that characterize the trees in the
  study area are considered. For this purpose, tree point clouds of diverse density
  will be used related to the seasonal changes and finally the results will be compared
  to existing reconstructed 3D tree models. The study area of this thesis is Green
  Village at TU Delft Campus. As a first approach, through literature research or
  assumptions it will be defined for which days in the year data should be collect
  for processing. Then, data of various kinds will be collected, including Illuminance
  sensor data of CCC Building in Green Village, AHN 4-point cloud data and data from
  in-situ laser scanning. Next, daylight simulation will be implemented with the resulted
  point clouds or them after some processing as inputs with either Climate Studio
  or custom code using Ladybug and Honeybee libraries. Lastly, the results will be
  evaluated.

- Enhancing Smart Point Clouds with HBIM Attributes for Dynamic Heritage Conservation
- Peter van Oosterom
- Yingwen Yu
- This research integrates Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) with smart
  point clouds (SPC) to advance the conservation and management of heritage structures.
  HBIM, leveraging detailed data about heritage buildings, enhances both structural
  health monitoring and decision-making in conservation projects. The study aims to
  enrich SPC with HBIM attributes, creating a dynamic update system that actively
  manages and monitors heritage sites. Using terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry,
  the project will capture detailed site data, segment point clouds, and apply machine
  learning for refined tagging, ensuring the HBIM accurately reflects the current
  state of the site. This integration facilitates ongoing preservation efforts by
  maintaining a real-time, enriched model of heritage structures.

- Reconstructing Complete Roof Geometries from Sparse and Incomplete Point Cloud Data
- Weixiao Gao
- Hugo Ledoux
- 'Roof shape reconstruction  into 3D models from airborne LiDAR point clouds remains
  challenging due to occlusions, artifacts, and sparsity issues in large-scale scanning.
  While existing methods have made progress in general point cloud completion, they
  face significant limitations when applied to roof reconstruction, particularly in
  preserving fine architectural details, maintaining sharp edges, and ensuring accurate
  scale alignment. These challenges are especially pronounced in complex buildings
  with multiple roof planes and irregular structures, where current approaches often
  result in loss of small-scale features, over-smoothing of sharp edges, and normalization
  inconsistencies.

  This thesis aims to develop an automated method for reconstructing accurate and
  detailed 3D roof models from incomplete LiDAR point cloud data. Leveraging recent
  advances in machine learning, I will explore approaches such as generative models,
  multi-modal learning, and point cloud densification using Gaussian splatting, selecting
  the most promising method for further refinement. The expected outcome is a efficient
  pipeline capable of handling complex and detailed roof geometries ensuring accuracy,
  sharpness, and scale consistency. The AHN dataset and 3D BAG building models serve
  as both training and validation data.'

- 'To provide more insight into the ownership rights of apartment buildings and enable
  integrating the 3D apartment units in other 3D data sets like the 3DBAG, the Dutch
  Cadastre (Kadaster) is working on automating the conversion of analogue floor plan
  deeds into 3D models. Previous research by the Kadaster has focused on vectorizing
  the deeds, and identified the main further challenge as automating the process of
  georeferencing and scaling. My research will address the question: How can 2D vectorized
  ownership deeds be georeferenced and reconstructed into a 3D model? I propose using
  the vectorized deeds as input and research the reconstruction process with the following
  steps:

  Step 1. Georeferencing

  In order to register the 3D model to the correct location, it needs to be georeferenced.
  The focus of the research lies in the automating the process of finding accurate
  anchor points in the deeds, and assigning geographical coordinates to them.

  Step 2. 3D reconstruction from 2D polygons to 3D volumes

  The plans can then be lifted into 3D using the height and number of floors estimates
  from the 3DBAG. Solutions to various scenarios will be researched, such as multilevel
  apartments, split-level floors and floors that are shifted rather than aligned directly
  above one another. The primary goal is to create a simple visualization, but if
  time allows, aligning the models with BIM legal standards and alternative approaches
  to visualizing ownership could be explored.'

- 'Point clouds are the raw data of the real world, change detection analysis between
  the point clouds enables analysts to detect, quantify and interpret spatial changes
  directly. This thesis aims to develop and explore methods for detecting significant
  differences between point clouds generated at different times. The focus is not
  on identifying the differing points, but on recognizing the actual objects that
  have been added or removed. Key considerations in this thesis include how to effectively
  visualize these differences: should the raw data or the reconstructed object be
  displayed when an added or removed object is shown? Additionally, the research will
  address how these changes should be incorporated into the dataset. While the algorithm
  is tested using the AHN datasets, it is designed to be adaptable to point clouds
  of varying densities.'
