## What you have to do for each A

### A0 (Preparation)

- check that the supervisors are the ones that were agreed upon and approve it in MyCase
- schedule the A1 date in SuperSaaS before the deadline

### A1 (Kick-off)

- both supervisors should read A1 proposal
- both supervisors must attend A1, and ask questions
- both supervisors jointly decide if it's a go (continue) or nogo (retake)
- 1st supervisor must put in the system the final result of the A1
- if it's a go, both supervisors, student and delegate should decide on A3 and A4 dates from the slots available in SuperSaaS and enter it in the system
- if it's a no/go, the same but for a new A1 date in the next period

### A2 (Midterm)

- between A1 and A3, there should one meeting to discuss the progress of the student
- feedback must be given, with tips to improve
- after the student has uploaded a document in MyCase (eg thesis as it stands or the slides used for a A2 presentation), the 1st supervisor must mark the A2 as done in the system by selecting Continue to Green Light phase.

### A3 (Green light)

- before A3 a co-reader must be chosen
- the co-reader must skim/read the draft version and submit comments and potential questions to the 1st supervisor. The co-reader doesn't need to attend A3.
- both supervisors must read carefully the draft and ensure that the student has a chance to pass. You're wasting everyone's time if you know you'll give a nogo and still have the A3.
- you have to assess if the work is original, and thus you need to go to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan thingy](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/mark/folder_submissions_users.d2l?db=148114&ou=47493) and check the report. ([Full details here](../rules/Nieuw_Teacher_mail_V4.docx)).
- both supervisors must attend A3
- 1st supervisor must put in the system the result of A3

### A4 (Finalisation)

- you have to assess if the work is original, and thus you need to go to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan thingy](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/mark/folder_submissions_users.d2l?db=148117&ou=47493) and check the report. ([Full details here](../rules/Nieuw_Teacher_mail_V4.docx)).
- both supervisors must attend A4, and the co-reader, and ask questions
- grade the student with [the rubric](../rubric/)
- make a speech in front of family and friends
- smile a lot while doing this
- 1st supervisor must put the final grade in the system
